# SVM-MLP-Classification
Application of different classification approaches to a challenging dataset to compare the results, to enhance the accuracy of the learnt models via selecting better parameters/preprocessing/using kernels/incorporating background knowledge  

### Goal
The goal of this task is to apply different classification approaches to a challenging dataset to compare the results, to enhance the accuracy of the learnt models via selecting better parameters/preprocessing/using kernels/incorporating background knowledge. The goal of the this task is to learn binary classification models that distinguish class1 from the other two classes
